With over a decade in front-end development, including strong command of JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and practical experience with React, I am prepared to make an immediate impact within your micro frontend environment and contribute to your impressive growth trajectory.<br><br>At NYU Tisch School of the Arts, I led front-end development, emphasizing UX/UI design, WCAG accessibility, and architecture for academic websites, ensuring highly interactive and inclusive digital experiences. Prior to this, at The Walt Disney Company, I developed and maintained prominent web properties, where I was instrumental in creating and integrating CMS data objects, style sheets, and sprites for multiple branded sites. This foundational work directly translates to building and maintaining sophisticated in-house design systems and delivering scalable solutions for bsport’s key product verticals. My background also includes devising a research-based web game interface at Vanderbilt University, demonstrating my capacity to deliver engaging, scalable products within an agile, product-focused setting.<br><br>My commitment to ownership and proactive problem-solving extends beyond technical execution; as a Creative Technologist &amp; Professor at NYU, I instruct and mentor students in front-end web development, accessibility, and interface design. This teaching and leadership experience has honed my communication skills, preparing me to lead complex technical projects and effectively collaborate with a growing engineering team. I am eager to apply my initiative to tackle technical debt and contribute to the development of reliable, scalable solutions that support bsport’s ambitious goal of tripling its valuation.</div><div data-v-ee6f1533="">I am confident that my blend of deep technical expertise, proven leadership in front-end architecture and UX/UI, and dedication to building scalable, user-centric products makes me an ideal candidate for this Senior Frontend Engineer role.
