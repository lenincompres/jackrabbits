  <h1>Jack Rabbits — Rules Written in Verse</h1>

  <p><strong>Jack Rabbits</strong> is a modular fantasy board game whose <em>entire instructional system</em> is written in poetic meter.</p>

  <p>
    Rather than separating rules from narrative or flavor text, Jack Rabbits presents its mechanics as
    <strong>formal verse designed to function as a complete, precise rulebook</strong>.
    The verses are not symbolic, metaphorical, or interpretive.
    They are written to be <strong>clear, direct, concise, and mechanically unambiguous</strong>,
    with rhyme and meter acting as an added structural constraint.
  </p>

  <h2>Two Languages, Two Meters</h2>

  <p>
    The rules exist in parallel poetic systems, each using a different classical structure:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Spanish</strong> rules are written in <strong>heroic verse</strong>, composed of
      <strong>hendecasyllabic lines (11 syllables)</strong> with
      <strong>three principal stresses per line</strong>, following traditional Spanish metrics used
      in didactic and epic writing.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>English</strong> rules are written in <strong>trochaic tetrameter</strong>, consisting of
      <strong>four stressed–unstressed pairs per line</strong>, most often <strong>catalectic</strong>,
      ending on a final stressed syllable.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In both languages, syllable counts and stress patterns are intentionally controlled.
    The rules are authored to remain <strong>functionally equivalent</strong>,
    despite differences in rhythm and linguistic structure.
  </p>

  <h2>Clarity Under Constraint</h2>

  <p>
    The primary design goal of the rulebook is <strong>clarity and playability</strong>.
    All mechanics are expressed plainly, without allegory or poetic ambiguity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meter and rhyme are not used to embellish or obscure meaning,
    but to introduce an additional constraint—one that demands precision,
    economy of language, and careful structuring of instructions.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Verse?</h2>

  <p>
    Verse has long been used to preserve complex systems because
    <strong>meter aids memory, oral transmission, and consistency</strong>.
    Jack Rabbits applies this principle deliberately:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rhythm supports recall during play</li>
    <li>Fixed meter exposes inconsistencies quickly</li>
    <li>Verse facilitates oral explanation and teaching</li>
    <li>Constraint discourages redundancy and vagueness</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design as a Formal Experiment</h2>

  <p>
    Writing complete, playable rules in verse adds a design layer beyond balance and usability.
    Each mechanic must withstand:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Translation between languages</li>
    <li>Translation between metrical systems</li>
    <li>Playtesting without loss of precision</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The poetic structure is not decoration;
    it is a <strong>design constraint</strong> that shapes how rules are conceived,
    refined, and tested.
  </p>

  <h2>A Contemporary Practice with Ancient Roots</h2>

  <p>
    Jack Rabbits draws inspiration from oral traditions,
    medieval didactic poetry, and constrained writing practices,
    while remaining a fully modern tabletop game.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>What happens when the rules themselves are built to be remembered?</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Any prose summaries (when used for marketing, accessibility, or teaching)
    are complementary; the verse is written to be sufficient for play.
